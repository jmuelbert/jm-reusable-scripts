# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

At the moment checkconnect only considers the very latest commit to be supported. We combine that with our fast response to incidents and the automated updates to minimize the time between vulnerability publication and patch release.

| Version       | Supported          |
| :------------ | :----------------- |
| master        | :white_check_mark: |
| other commits | :x:                |

In the near future we will introduce versioning, so expect this section to change.
