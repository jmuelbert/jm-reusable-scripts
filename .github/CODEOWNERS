# This file does not signify real code owners. We use it to automate the
# process of assigning code reviews. But generally all members of the
# project own the whole product.


# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
#       @global-owner1 @global-owner2

# You can also use email addresses if you prefer. They'll be
# used to look up users just like we do for commit author
# emails.
#.go docs@example.com

# The `src/*`pattern will match files like
src/*                           @jmuelbert

# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like
docs/*                          @jmuelbert
pages/*                         @jmuelbert

# Normally, *.ui, *.cpp and *.h files are reviewed by the core-cpp team only
# All files containing UI text are reviewed by the ui-review team
